	<h1> Hello, World! </h1>
	<h2> This is my test of a basic HTML website </h2>

	<p> HTML is one of the easiest programming languages you can use. It has simple syntax, lax standards, and every computer in the world can view a basic HTML page, unlike the bloated mess that is JavaScript! </p>

	<p> No need to chase the dragon of "progress". Reject bloat.</p>
