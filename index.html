        <p> Welcome to my website. This was created with GitHub Pages, Vim, PHP, and some spare time. I want this to serve as a "Portfolio" of sorts for my various homelab and Linux related projects that I have done in my spare time. My goal is to pivot my career path away from construction and into IT or web design </p>

<p> While I am completely self-taught in the field  of Computer Science, my genuine passion for it has allowed me to become relatively competent. Below, you can see a list of my projects. Some images have been included for reference, though they are not actual pictures of said projects. </p>

        <ul>
                <li>Jellyfin Media Server - Homemade Netflix. This allowed me to stream all of my legally purchased, digital movies and home videos from any of my device
s.</li>
        </ul>
