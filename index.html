	<p> Welcome to my website. I am an aspiring web developer and by that, I mean that I want to make interesting things to share with people on the internet and I do not give a shit if it lands me a job or not. I drive trucks for a living and I am rather happy doing that to pay my bills. </p>

	<p> I started my Linux journey around 2021-2022, with a hand-me-down computer. Windows 10 made me physically ill, so I dove into the world of the penguin, which is what got me interested in learing how to code. I am hoping that getting a good grasp of HTML will allow me to better understand and remember the syntax of actual programming languages, so I can write my own Linux drivers for some bespoke hardware I have.</p>

	<p> I have tried just about every distribution under the sun. Ubuntu, Arch, Debian, NixOS, even some of the BSDs. Not Gentoo though, not patient enough for that. Currently, I am using <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/workstation/">Fedora Workstation</a> on my <a href="https://press.hp.com/content/dam/sites/garage-press/press/press-kits/2021/ces-2021/hp_probook_x360_435_g8_media_spec_sheet.pdf"> HP laptop</a>. My favorite desktop linux I used was Red Hat but those packages are a bit too old for my liking. Fedora works well enough. I use containers to keep my development programs away from my base system. Who knows how much of a difference it makes but it sure does make me feel better. </p>

		<p> People love to give unsolicited advice about what you should do, what you should do it, and how you should think. When learning something new or hunting for a product that you want, try to remember that Reddit is not the entire internet, nor is it a place of intelligent people. Multiple companies have been <a href="https://larslofgren.com/reddit-marketing/">caught shilling products</a> and these are just <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2017/02/20/reddit-is-being-manipulated-by-big-financial-services-companies/">the ones who got caught.</a>  </p>

		<h4> I am a firm believer that a website should never take up more ram than an entire operating system from the 90's. Greedy companies will gaslight you into thinking that you should have the latest and greatest machine to do the same thing you did 20 years ago on hardware that was a tenth of the power you have now. I promise you that my website will never be incompatible with old machines. I love old computers and hate greed. </h4>
