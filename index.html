	<p> Welcome to my website. I am an aspiring web developer and by that, I mean that I want to make interesting things to share with people on the internet and I do not give a care if it lands me a job or not. I drive trucks for a living and I am rather happy doing that to pay my bills. </p>

	<p> I got my first personal computer in 2010. I would tinker in the registry of Windows 7 to make things work for my games, which is what got me interested in learing how computers work and how to code. I am hoping that getting a good grasp of HTML will allow me to better understand and remember the syntax of actual programming languages, so I can write my own Linux drivers for some bespoke hardware I have.</p>

	<p> Linux is cool. I really just like it because I hate Windows and it doesn't spy on me wihtout my consent. Currently, I am using Artix Linux on my <a href="https://press.hp.com/content/dam/sites/garage-press/press/press-kits/2021/ces-2021/hp_probook_x360_435_g8_media_spec_sheet.pdf"> HP laptop</a>. </p>

		<h5> I was on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freecodecamp</a> the other day (without an ad blocker) and my computer started getting crazy hot and the fans went to 100%. I hovered over the tab and it said Chrome was using almost 2 GB of ram for a single website. That is crazy and let me tell you why. </h5>

			<li> Ram is expensive</li>
